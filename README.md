# KaggleDisasterTweetsChallenge
This repo contains our work on the Kaggle Disaster Tweets challenge.  
The Kaggle challenge is located here: https://www.kaggle.com/c/nlp-getting-started

From Kaggle: "In this competition, you’re challenged to build a machine learning model that predicts which Tweets are about real disasters and which one’s aren’t. You’ll have access to a dataset of 10,000 tweets that were hand classified."

This challenge focuses on Natural Language Processing (NLP).
